<!-- ## About Me -->
I received my Automation degree from Wuhan University, 2017/03 - 2021/06. I am now pursuing my master degree under the supervision [Prof. Yujiu Yang](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=4gH3sxsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, 2022/03 - present.

Now, I am interning at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html), Tencent Rhino-Bird Elite Training Program 2022-2023. My mentor is Tencent AI Lab senior researcher [Xing Wang](http://xingwang4nlp.com/), whose research interests include neural/statistical machine translation and large language models (for machine translation).


## Research
I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Current interests include:
- Multi-Agent Intelligence with LLMs
- Human-Like Machine Translation
- AI Safety and Alignment
